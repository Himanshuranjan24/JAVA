/*7. A plastic manufacturer sells plastic in different shapes like Two_D sheet and Three_D box. The cost of sheet is Rs 40/ per square ft.
and the cost of box is Rs 60/ per cubic ft. Implement it in Java to calculate the cost of plastic as per the dimensions given by the user
where Three_D inherits from Two_D. */
